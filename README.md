# Cardano's staking pool operator (SPO)

This repository is dedicated to providing a comprehensive set of resources and tools for Cardano Staking Pool Operators (SPOs). If you are an SPO or aspiring to become one, this repository is designed to help you build, run, and monitor Cardano nodes efficiently.

## Key Features

### Building and Running Cardano Nodes

- Step-by-step guides for building Cardano nodes from source code.
- Dockerfiles and instructions for creating Docker images of Cardano nodes.
- Docker Compose configurations to simplify the deployment and management of Cardano nodes in a containerized environment.

### Scripts (Bash Shell/Python)

- A collection of shell scripts for managing various aspects of a Cardano node, such as starting, stopping, and updating the node software.
- Scripts for wallet management, working with metadata, and interacting with the Cardano network.
- Python scripts specifically designed to assist SPOs in operating their Cardano Staking Pools.
- Scripts for monitoring the node's health and performance, checking block production, managing stake pools, and handling transactions.

### Monitoring and Alerting

- Best practices and guides for monitoring Cardano nodes using industry-standard tools like Prometheus and Grafana.
- Configurations for monitoring critical metrics, setting up alerts, and ensuring optimal node performance and uptime.

This repository aims to provide SPOs with the necessary resources and tools to streamline their Cardano node operations, manage stake pools effectively, and monitor the health and performance of their nodes. It offers a comprehensive set of scripts, guides, and configurations, allowing SPOs to focus on running successful Cardano Staking Pools.

Feel free to contribute your own scripts, improvements, or suggestions to make this repository a valuable resource for the Cardano community of Staking Pool Operators.
